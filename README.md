# MyFriends: Balatro Mod
Mod for Balatro: Featuring some of my friends and me!

This is a silly little mod for Balatro by LocalThunk which adds 5 new jokers. To install it, download the zipped file (myFriends.zip) and put it into your Mods folder. 

Dependencies: [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) v1.0.0, [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) >=0.6
Is it compatible with other mods? 
- Not with Cryptid
- That is all I know

This was a passion project of mine for a little bit, as I just wanted to learn how to make simple Balatro mods, I might come back and add even more friends in the future. Also shoutout to all my friends for letting me do this and supporting me in the process, and everybody that helped me in the [Balatro Discord](https://discord.gg/EduqYhDk).


What does this mod add you may ask? Only the most unbalanced Jokers ever. 
### Here is the roster (SPOILERS AHEAD):

## Ahren ~ Inconspicuous Egg

*Triples the blind requirement, you earn $20 after every hand, self-destructs after the round*
 
I totally meant to only give 20$ when you beat the blind, but it’s kinda funnier this way

## Zirka ~ BLUE

*Gives +555 chips, X0.6 mult, and creates a random planet card*

The goal was to create a High Card planet card, but that was unsuccessful. Also yes the mult being lower is supposed to be a drawback for the massive chip gain

## Ore - Reckoning

*When the Joker is in hand, you get 0 discards, but X8 mult on the last hand*

Busted, that’s all I can say

## Roman - We Do Some Trolling

*Gives +42 mult and X10 mult but there is a 1 in 9 chance every blind selected that the game just ends*

This is my favourite Joker by far, just the fact that if you are lucky enough you can technically beat everything, but if not then you just die.

## Andrew (me) - Benevolent Creator

*During first played hand, creates copies equal to the size of the played hand minus 1, destroys the rest. If the played hand is only one card, every card will be debuffed*

Great concept, terrible execution. Probably the buggiest code of all time, but that also just makes it funny. 

Hope you enjoy!
